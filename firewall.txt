The VServer model is: one firewall for everybody (no per-vserver
firewall).

So there's a centralised configuration for the firewall. It's located
in /etc/network/firewall.sh, and is called through a pre-up entry in
/etc/network/interfaces. It's just a shell script that uses the
'iptables' command repeatedly.


The firewall rejects everything directly, with --with-tcp-reset to be
more efficient, instead of DROPing packets. I like being able to nmap
Savannah and see at once what ports are opened and which one ought to
be closed. This also makes testing more efficient. The RSH port is
rejected with a special irrelevant "protocol not available" error
message, which allows an immediate diagnostic when somebody forgot to
'export CVS_RSH=ssh' ;)

Internal VServer with IP adresses within 10.0.0.0/24 get some SNAT to
be able to access the Internet.


There are some outgoing rules as well; they are not meant for
filtering (the default policy is ACCEPT), but they provide accounting,
so a 'iptables -vL' can tell you how much traffic was delivered per
service when since the last iptables restart.


To update the firewall, you essentially edit /etc/network/firewall.sh,
pray, and run it directly. In case of troubles, ask an admin with
serial access to log as root2 and fix the firewall.
