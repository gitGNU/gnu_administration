This file describes a procedure you need to follow in order to finish
migrating a project from CVS to GIT.  It is supposed that the CVS to GIT
mirror for that project was already operational. Throughout these
instructions the word PROJECT stands for the actual system name of the
project in question.

* vcs-noshell

All actions are performed in the vcs-noshell virtual server, so, to begin
with, you need to do:

  vserver vcs-noshell enter

First part of the procedure must be done with the privileges of the
cvs2git user.  The second part requires root privileges.
  
* Part 1: as cvs2git

The commands in this part turn off the mirroring and disable the CVS
repository.

** Switch to cvs2git user

  su - cvs2git

** Turn off the mirroring of PROJECT

Edit cvs2git's crontab file.  Run

   crontab -e

Find the relevant line and remove it.  The line in question will look like:

   35,50 * * * *      $HOME/bin/mirror-sv-sv PROJECT

** Ensure that there is no crontab job syncing to git

** Disable the CVS repository

This step removes all files from the repository and checks in a
single README-use-git file, instructing where to find the new repository.

Run the script

   bin/sv-cvs-delete-all PROJECT

** Leave cvs2git privileges

Type ^D or logout

* Part 2: as root

The commands in this part disable write access to the CVS repository and
configure the corresponding GIT repo, which operated as a mirror so far,
for read/write access.

** Disable CVS commit access

Run

   /root/Meyering/cvs-no-commit PROJECT

** Adjust permissions in GIT repo

Run

   /root/Meyering/git-adjust-perms PROJECT

** Fix project description

The git-adjust-perms script warns if the description of the PROJECT contains a
word "mirror" in it. If so, open the file PROJECT.git/description with your
editor and fix the description.
