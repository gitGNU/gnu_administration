This directory contains aliases for @savannah.gnu.org, which mainly
allow us to define a set of valid senders on the GNU mail system
(since Savannah doesn't receive any mail directly). E.g.:
www-data@savannah.gnu.org, INVALID.NOREPLY@savannah.gnu.org,
libcrsync@savannah.gnu.org, ...

The 'aliases' file is fetched from the GNU mail system via rsync.

The cron job runs every hour at one minute after the hour.
